I was graduated from  National Cheng Kung University and got master degree of electrical engineering, 
and i majored in control theory. Because i was interested in playing cameras, i joined Ability coporate
and developed cameras as a firmware engineer after my graduation. During this three years, i also 
studied some things by myself after my work time, like building website, writing android app, building web robot,
AI application ...etc. I love and enjoy learning theses things and always keep myself updated of
new technology. Specific description about what i do can refer to my projects section below.
