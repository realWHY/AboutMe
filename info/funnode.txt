This project was that i first practiced building backend by Node.js. Though there were
many server-side environment like jsp, asp, php, django ... i could choose, The reason why i 
choose node.js is for its features like : 
<br/>
1.Asynchronous I/O that optimizes an application's throughput and scalability.
<br/>
2.Node.js is Javascript. The same language can be used on the backend and frontend.   
  This means it breaks down the boundaries between front- and back-end development.
<br/>
3.built-in library to allow applications to act as a Web server without software such 
  as Apache HTTP Server.
<br/>
4.Event-driven programming.
<br/>
I think the above features are the most attractive parts for me and i also learn how to write
MVC structure by node.js. Though i love node.js, there are lots of advantages that other server-side 
environment have. So in the future, i plan that i may learn PHP and Django in the future.
