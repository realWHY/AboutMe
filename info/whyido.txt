I had thought that making money is the most important thing in one's life. But in the recent years,
as i knew more and grew in my mind, i found that the most important thing is "people" actually. 
I don't mean that money is not important, but not the most important thing. What is happiness and 
where it come from? Making money can't bring me real happiness. Only when i impact others
can i feel truly happy. For the reason, i want to improve myself and i want to know more things to be a better 
person so that i can use my ability to make this world a better place.
