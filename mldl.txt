When i first found the book <a href=" http://www2.ift.ulaval.ca/~chaib/IFT-4102-7025/public_html/Fichiers/Machine_Learning_in_Action.pdf" target="_blank">Machine Learning in Action </a> 
and read the catalog, i think it is so cool that algorithms can classify emails or recognize handwritings
or even predict something. It triggered my interest to dig into the content and then i gradually understood
how machine learning works. Basically, there are three types of machine learning and deep learning.
Classification¡BRegression which are supervised learning and Cluster which is unsupervised learning.
After I had basic concept of how them work, i started to use scickit-learn to do some practices and searched
some information on internet. Moreover, i started to learn the concept of deep learning, reinforce learning
and used tensorflow, keras to make some little projects. Among all algorithms, i love convolutional neural 
network most, because it is so cool that a model can tell what an image is! I think i'll continuously
study AI stuff in the future!
