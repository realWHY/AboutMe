I had learnt written android by following some books and practiced the exercises on them. But after
i bought ipad, i thought the performance of Android is much slower and it cause me to lose much enthusiasm on Android. 
Maybe i won't use Android Studio to write android app if not necessary in the future, but i think 
i will use React Native in the future to write mobile apps which can cross all the platforms including Ios and 
Android. In addition, an app written by React Native is claimed to perform like a real native app, so i
think React Native is cool to help developer to save a lot of time to build apps on different platforms 
without losing much performance.
