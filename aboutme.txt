Taiwan, where i come from, is a beautiful and democratic place. because of living in a democratic 
place, this makes me have many opinions and ideas about public issues and i usually care about what's 
going on in the world. Besides, I love learning things, and i think to know more and get more knowledge 
is an exciting thing for me. Usually, i learn technical skills like web, app, AI..etc that i can
apply to my life or other's life to make world better and interesting, and also i love to read
books like life, business, philosophy...etc in my casual time. In my opinion, i think reading books 
is an very effective way to enrich my life, because a books is usually a epitome of one's life and 
i can get knowledge from author's life study or experience. Therefore, i have decided that i will 
learning for life.
